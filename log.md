# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises of CSS and AVD on CodeCamp.org . Finished my Java RMI project for the Distributed Systems class and did some progress on Data Science with Python on edX.  
  
**Thoughts:** I'm very excited with the 100DaysOfCode. CSS and AVD are very interesting subjects. I'm very excited to keep doing progresses on them. Java RMI is really boring sometimes and i had to work hard to finish the project. The Data Science with Python course its exciting me. I'm very anxious to do my first project with the knowledge i'm absorving.

### Day 2: October 9, 2018  
  
**Today's Progress**: Forked and made commit's on some repositories to make progress on HacktoberFest. Forked the 100DaysOfCode repo to record my progress everyday.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes i had some difficult with the commits but i made some pull request's implementing the BubbleSort and QuickSort algorithms using Python. I just started doing something on GitHub so i'm having a few difficulties sometimes.

### Day 3: October 10, 2018  
  
**Today's Progress**: I finally finished the AVD section and started de Applied Accessibility section of Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp. Besides that, I did some exercises of the Data Science with Python on edX about DataFrames with Pandas.

**Thoughts**: I'm really enjoying the Responsive Web Design Certification of FreeCodeCamp and I feeling i'm doing progress. The DataScience course is a little bit delayed but I hope to put the things on the rail again and keep doing a hard work on those subjects.

### Day 4 October 11 2018  
  
**Today's Progress**: Today, I spent the day making a script with Python that checks if I'm on my university network and if I'm there, connect automatically to the portal of the university (here, we need to do login with our credentials to access the internet on the University).  

**Thoughts**: Discover how I check if I'm connected to my University network was really hard. In the end, I just check if I'm connected to the IP range that the university uses. The part of access the site and do the login was very easy but I need to study a little bit more networks.
