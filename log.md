# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did some exercises of CSS and AVD on CodeCamp.org . Finished my Java RMI project for the Distributed Systems class and did some progress on Data Science with Python on edX.  
  
**Thoughts:** I'm very excited with the 100DaysOfCode. CSS and AVD are very interesting subjects. I'm very excited to keep doing progresses on them. Java RMI is really boring sometimes and i had to work hard to finish the project. The Data Science with Python course its exciting me. I'm very anxious to do my first project with the knowledge i'm absorving.

### Day 2: October 9, 2018  
  
**Today's Progress**: Forked and made commit's on some repositories to make progress on HacktoberFest. Forked the 100DaysOfCode repo to record my progress everyday.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes i had some difficult with the commits but i made some pull request's implementing the BubbleSort and QuickSort algorithms using Python. I just started doing something on GitHub so i'm having a few difficulties sometimes.
